  "description": "'Fallen' tells the story of a highly survivalistic reptillian being who awakens on a derelict space station to discover that they are the last of their kind. From there, the player is given the opportunity to build an alien craft and begin exploring the galaxy. All of the content and missions from the original Endless Sky are there to experience and enjoy just as you normally would, but now you can do so from a different perspective and with a wide variety of new ships and weapons. Missions specific to 'Fallen' will be offered as you progress and become stronger, which will in turn unlock more advanced equipment, while simultaneously increasing the tactical challenges that the player is presented with.",
