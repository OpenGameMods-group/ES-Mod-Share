# ES-Mod-Share
Mod sharing website for Endless Sky
You may have to give the website permission to show dialog boxes. Using Google Chrome is strongly recommended.

You can add a mod by going to the js folder and editing the mods file, you can see how mods are added and some info. Don't worry about your upload being 100% correct and bug free. I check every upload and approve / edit it as needed. It's pretty simple, and a tutorial will be added later.

This was just an example of how a mod sharing site could be done on Github, but it looks like this may be used instead of a different website. There will be upload requirements, and standard image sizes / tags added soon, but don't worry about that right now. First, I need at least 11 mods to be added here to continue development. (11 mods to test multiple pages, 10 mods / page, and to work on the search feature) I've added a few myself already, but I would like others to add mods on their own so I could see any potential problems and fix them.
